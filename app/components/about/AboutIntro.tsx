                I’ve always found joy in making things. Whether it was photo
                editing, anime-style art, dabbling in music production, or video
                editing, the process of creating something from scratch has
                always felt exciting. Coding naturally became part of that
                journey—at first through playful introductions, then through
                more structured learning. For me, technology has always been a
                canvas where creativity meets logic.

                My passions are mostly centered indoors, preferably with air
                conditioning. Still, I’m open to trying new things like
                sculpting or woodworking one day. Outside of hands-on hobbies,
                I’m curious about philosophy, science, psychology, mythology,
                and history. Reading is another passion of mine, whether it’s
                manga, light novels, or classics like <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>.

                My biggest inspiration is my grandfather, a handyman who could
                fix or build just about anything. His wisdom and quiet strength
                made him a teacher and guide to others, including me. Alongside
                my grandmother, he was my emotional anchor growing up while my
                parents worked abroad.

                Professionally, what drives me is building, problem-solving, and
                continuous learning—much like my grandfather, who was always
                creating something useful. I aim to become a computer scientist
                with a wide toolkit of skills, ready to contribute meaningfully
                to technology and communities around me.
